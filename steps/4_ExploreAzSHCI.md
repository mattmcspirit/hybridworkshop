Explore the management of your Azure Stack HCI 21H2 environment
==============
Overview
-----------
With the Azure Stack HCI cluster deployed, you can now begin to explore some of the additional capabilities within Azure Stack HCI 21H2 and Windows Admin Center. We'll cover a few recommended activities below, to expose you to some of the key elements of the Windows Admin Center, but for the rest, we'll [direct you over to the official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/hci/ "Azure Stack HCI 21H2 documentation").

Create volumes for VMs
-----------
In this step, you'll create a volume on the Azure Stack HCI 21H2 cluster by using Windows Admin Center, and enable data deduplication and compression.

### Create a two-way mirror volume ###

1. Once logged into the **Windows Admin Center** on **HybridHost001**, click on your previously deployed cluster, **azshciclus.hybrid.local**
2. On the left hand navigation, under **Storage** select **Volumes**.  The central **Volumes** page shows you should have a single volume currently
3. On the Volumes page, select the **Inventory** tab, and then select **Create**
4. In the **Create volume** pane, leave the default for for the volume name, and leave **Resiliency** as **Two-way mirror**
5. In Size on HDD, specify **250GB** for the size of the volume
6. Under **More options**, tick the box for **Use deduplication and compression**
7. Under **Data type**, use the drop-down to select **Hyper-V**, then click **Create**.

![Create a volume on Azure Stack HCI 21H2](/media/wac_vm_storage_ga.png "Create a volume on Azure Stack HCI 21H2")

8. Creating the volume can take a few minutes. Notifications in the upper-right will let you know when the volume is created. The new volume appears in the Inventory list

![Volume created on Azure Stack HCI 21H2](/media/wac_vm_storage_deployed_ga.png "Volume created on Azure Stack HCI 21H2")

**NOTE** - You'll notice there are 3 options for **Data type**; default, Hyper-V and Backup.  If you're interested in learning more about Deduplication in Azure Stack HCI 21H2, you should [refer to our documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/data-deduplication/overview "Deduplication overview")

You now have a volume created and ready to accept workloads. Whilst we deployed the volume using the Windows Admin Center, you can also do the same through PowerShell. If you're interested in taking that approach, [check out the official docs that walk you through that process](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/hci/manage/create-volumes "Official documentation for creating volumes"). For more information on planning volumes with Azure Stack HCI 21H2, you should [refer to the official docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/hci/concepts/plan-volumes "Planning volumes for Azure Stack HCI 21H2").

Deploy a virtual machine
-----------
In this step, you'll deploy a VM onto your new volume, using Windows Admin Center.

### Download a Windows Server 2019 evaluation image ###

1. Please download a Windows Server 2019 evaluation image (ISO) file from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2019%253Ffiletype=ISO)

2. Select ISO and complete the form with your details before you click on **Continue**. Download the .iso and save in the Downloads folder

16. Accept the license terms and select **"Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)"** and then click **Next**. It will take around 10 minutes for the VM to boot. After that set the VM001 credetials. (do not forget them you will need them later!)

17. Click in **"Send Ctrl + Alt +Del"** at the top of the page now and login to the VM001

18. Right clink on the Start button and click on Windows PowerShell (Admin)

19. Execute the following PowerShell command **Rename-Computer -NewName VM001 -restart**. The hostname of the virtual machine will be changed to VM001 and the machine will restart.

20. Click **Disconnect**

You've successfully create a VM using the Windows Admin Center!

### Live migrate the virtual machine ###
The final step we'll cover is using Windows Admin Center to live migrate VM001 from it's current node, to an alternate node in the cluster.

1. Still within the **Windows Admin Center** on **HybridHost001**, under **Compute**, click on **Virtual machines**

2. On the **Virtual machines** page, select the **Inventory** tab

3. Under **Host server**, make a note of the node that VM001 is currently running on.  You may need to expand the column width to see the name

4. Next to **VM001**, click the tick box next to VM001, then click **More**.  You'll notice you can Clone, Domain Join and also Move the VM. Click **Move**

5. In the **Move Virtual Machine** pane, ensure **Failover Cluster** is selected, and leave the default **Best available cluster node** to allow Windows Admin Center to pick where to migrate the VM to. Make sure you have selected ** C:\ClusterStorage\Volume1** for the **"Path for the VM's files"** and you selected **ComputeSwitch** as your "Virtual switch on destination". Click **Move**,

6. The live migration will then begin, and within a few seconds, the VM should be running on a different node.

7. Click on **Yes** on the popup of Credential Security Service Provider CredSSP and then enter your username as **hybrid\azureuser** and password.

8. On the left hand navigation, under **Compute** select **Virtual machines** to return to the VM dashboard view, which aggregates information across your cluster, for all of your VMs.

### Arc enabled VM001 via Windows Admin Center ###

You should still be over on **HybridHost001**, but if you're not, log into HybridHost001, and open the **Windows Admin Center**.

1. Once logged into the **Windows Admin Center** on **HybridHost001**, click on your previously deployed cluster, **azshciclus.hybrid.local**

2. On the left hand navigation, under **Compute** select **Virtual machines**.  The central **Virtual machines** page shows VM001 in a running state

3. On the **Virtual machines** page, select the **Inventory** tab

4. Next to **VM001**, click the tick box next to VM001, then click **Connect**.  You'll notice you can "Connect", "Download RDP file" and also "Use Windows Admin Center". Click **Use Windows Admin Center**. A new Windows Admin Center Tab will open.

5. Select **Use another account for this connection**, provide the Username as **Administrator** and the password you have given while initialy deploying your Windows Server 2019 virtual machine. Leave the checkbox "use these credentials for all connections" unchecked! Click **Continue**

6. In **Windows Admin Center** go to **Server Manager**, here you should now see the server VM001 we just added to Windows Admin Center. Click on **VM001**

7. In the Tools section, click **Azure hybrid center**

8. In the **Available Services** tab, under point 1, Set up Azure Arc, click **Set up**. This step will Azure Arc for servers for this specific server.

9. Choose the right Azure subscription, create a new Resource group, with name **rg-myarcservers-hci**, and select Azure region **East US**. Click **Set up**. After a couple of minutes your virtual server running on your HCI cluster will be Arc enabled.

### View your Arc enabled Server in the Azure Portal from Windows Admin Center ###

1. In **Windows Admin Center** go to **Server Manager**, here you should now see the server VM001. Click on **VM001**.

2. In the Tools section, click **Azure hybrid center**

3. Click on the **Installed Services** tab and click **View server in Azure**. This will open a new browser tab with a view in the Azure portal on the server you just have Arc enabled.
